I just found this tutorial on [Sending Emails with the Zend Framework](http://www.techfounder.net/2008/07/18/handling-mail-and-mime-in-php-using-the-zend-framework/). This tutorial couldn’t get any simpler, and explains the process of using Zend_Mail in plain English – much easier to read than the Zend documentation! It starts out simple, and gets advanced. Also includes lots of examples!
