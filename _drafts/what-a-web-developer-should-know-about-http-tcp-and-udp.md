title: What a web developer should know about HTTP, TCP and UDP
---
In this tutorial, I'll cover the basics of networking as it relates to web application development.

## The difference between the "internet" and the "world wide web"

Over the years, the terms "web" and "internet" have become synonymous. However, in this tutorial, it's important to differentiate the two and understand the distinction.

 - The internet is what makes it possible to network computers across the globe. You pay your internet service provider for the ability to transfer data, using their wires, from one computer to another.
 - The web is made possible by the internet. Web pages are hosted using **web server software** listening for requests on **port 80**, using **TCP** as the data transfer protocol, and **HTTP** as the protocol for interacting with the web server.

You may not be familiar with some of those terms, so let's address those in more detail.

## Data transfer: TCP vs. UDP

## Addresses & Ports

## HTTP: Request & Response

## Web servers: Apache vs. the rest
