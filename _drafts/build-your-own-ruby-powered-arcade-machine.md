title: Build your own Ruby-powered arcade machine!
---

Hi, I'm Andrew Havens. Today I'm going to talk to you about building your own Ruby-powered arcade machine.

Here's an overview of what we're going to talk about in this session:

* How to write an "arcade game" in Ruby
* How to build an "arcade machine"
* How to run your own Ruby games on your arcade machine
* The future of Ruby game programming...?

Let's get started. But first, I need two volunteers. Who thinks they've got the fastest button pushin' fingers in the west?
