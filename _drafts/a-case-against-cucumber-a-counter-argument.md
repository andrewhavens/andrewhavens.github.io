title: A case against Cucumber: A Counter-argument 
---
The use of [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) for integration testing has become quite a contentious subject. It seems like most people either love or hate Cucumber. Even my local Ruby user-group had a [recent discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pdxruby/urH3OGseWfo) that degraded into Cucumber bashing.

I recently read an article titled [A Case Against Cucumber](http://blog.8thlight.com/kevin-liddle/2013/09/18/a-case-against-cucumber.html) which argues that Cucumber is never the right tool for the job unless business users are reading/writing the feature files. In this post I will offer a counter-argument that I hope will show that Cucumber can still be useful to developers.
