In the Ruby community, Cucumber gets mixed reviews. Appropriately so. But it's easy to get caught up in the hype or the drama and vote one way or the other. I've seen a lot of anti-Cucumber articles lately, but most of them miss the point. It's easy to do Cucumber wrong. It's easy to do a lot of things wrong in the world of "agile software development". Unfortunately, there aren't many resources on how to do Cucumber right. However, I've been using Cucumber for many years now and feel like I've overcome a lot of the headaches that seem to plague so many Cucumber users who ultimately abandon it. In this article, I'd like to take an objective look at Cucumber and debunk some myths/opinions that people use to justify their Cucumber bashing.

## Preference
As developers, we each have our individual preferences, ways that we like to work, and tools that we like to use to get the job done most effectively. I think it's important to acknowledge that. Far too often, we make authoritative claims that there is a single best tool for the job and that any other tool is invalid. I've even heard people say things like "you're a bad person" if you choose to use a particular tool. I'm not going to tell you and your team are wrong for using Cucumber or not using Cucumber. That's your decision to make.





I've been writing a lot of Cucumber features lately and wanted to document a few great resources I've found. Once you start writing features in Cucumber you quickly realize there's a difference between writing declarative features versus imperative features. tl;dr: declarative features are easier to read and easier to maintain.

Examples of declarative cucumber features:
 - [Writing Great Cucumber Features](http://chrismdp.github.com/2011/09/layers-of-abstraction-writing-great-cucumber-code/)
 - [Imperative vs. Declarative scenarios in user stories](http://benmabey.com/2008/05/19/imperative-vs-declarative-scenarios-in-user-stories.html)
 - [Whose domain is it anyway?](http://dannorth.net/2011/01/31/whose-domain-is-it-anyway/)
 - [You're cuking it wrong](http://www.elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong)

...I plan to go back and summarize these links in the future.
