Meeting Expectations
A Sprint Planning meeting is designed to identify, clarify, and break-down project work into manageable chunks. At the end of a Sprint Planning meeting, all team members (Designers, Engineers, and Strategists) should have a clear idea of the work that needs to be done and will be delivered by the end of the sprint. The first half of a Sprint Planning meeting is for reviewing the upcoming work in the Project Backlog. The second half of the meeting is to break down that work into tasks which can be assigned to individuals. Designers and Strategists do not need to stay for the second half of the meeting when Engineering tasks are broken-down into granular detail. However, Designers and Strategists are essential in the first half of the meeting to help clarify the requirements of the features in the Project Backlog.

Step 1: Determine Team Member Allocations
In our business, we have multiple projects for multiple clients going on simultaneously. COPIOUS team members may be involved in multiple projects for multiple clients throughout a COPIOUS-wide sprint. So it’s important to begin a Sprint Planning meeting by determining how much time will be available for each team member. It’s also important to take into account any long meetings or time out of the office which would reduce the total number of hours available for making progress on the project.

Step 2: Determine Client Project Priorities
Now that you’ve determined the number of hours available to each team member, you can determine which projects will be worked on during the sprint. Most clients may only have one project going on at a time. Some larger clients may have multiple projects going on, or projects requiring different roles (design, front-end engineering, back-end engineering). In order to track the progress of each project, each project should have its own sprint. That way you can decide how much time to commit to each project. Plan each project’s sprint one at a time. Don’t try to mix all the projects together into a single “client sprint” as it will become difficult to grasp how much progress is being made on a given project.

Step 3: Review Project Backlog
Sprints are planned by breaking down items in the Project’s Backlog. The Project Backlog is a list of Feature Requests (or User Stories) which have been prioritized according to the client’s business needs (highest priority appears at the top). Ideally, this backlog has been populated before the Sprint Planning meeting begins by meeting with the client and gathering requirements. By the time Sprint Planning takes place, it’s very likely that there have already been discussions with the client. Some documents could have been created, including an experience brief, or a functional spec. If you don’t have a Project Backlog, start by populating the Project Backlog with those User Stories. Items in the Project Backlog should be accompanied by their Acceptance Criteria (any requirements which must be implemented in order for the feature to be considered complete). Reviewing this backlog as a team can help to identify any blockers or undocumented requirements. For example, the Engineering team may realize that a wireframe needs to be completed before any engineering tasks can begin.
